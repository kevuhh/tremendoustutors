        How do I use the admin page?
      </h1>
      <h2>
        THE ORDER ALWAYS MATTERS IN THESE FIELDS. <br>
        NEVER PUT DOUBLE QUOTES INSIDE YOUR PROPERTIES/VALUE DOUBLE QUOTES, BECAUSE THEY CONFUSE THE JSON FORMATTING. SINGLE QUOTES ARE FINE.
      </h2>
      <p>
        For sessions, hours, and tutors just enter a number (no spaces or funky business, code is like that). <br>
        Don't leave any fields blank, though.
      </p>
      <h4>
        For the rest you need to understand the JSON format, in this case it is an array [] and inside each object is identified by the {} and separated with commas.
        For example: [{"property":"value", "property2":"value2"},{"property":"value", "property2":"value2"},{"property":"value", "property2":"value2"}] would enter three objects with two properties each with their own corresponding values.
      </h4>
      <p>
        For feed, a single object needs a date property, enter the date for the value, and a summary property, enter the text for the value. If you want a hyperlink make sure to look that up, too hard to explain here. Basically it would need to be wrapped with 'a' tags. <br>
        For example, three objects with the data needed would look like this, [{"date":"03/20/2021","summary":"You removed <a href="">Jenny Hess</a> to your <a href="">coworker</a> group."},{"date":"02/25/2021","summary":"You removed Jenny Hess to your coworker group."},{"date":"02/25/2021","summary":"You removed Jenny Hess to your coworker group."}]
      </p>
      <p>
        For tutors, a single object needs a name, grade, description, favorite subject, and image file name. Image file needs to be preloaded into the server. <br>
        For example, two objects with the data needed would look like this, [{"name":"Jane Doe","grade":"11","desc":"I like teaching","subj":"Chemistry","imgFileName":"fillerperson1.jpg"},{"name":"Cool Cam","grade":"10","desc":"I also like teaching","subj":"Math","imgFileName":"fillerperson2.jpg"}]
      </p>
      <p>
        For faqs, a single object needs a question and an answer property.
        For example, five objects with the needed data would look like this, [{"question":"Are tutoring sessions virtual or in person?","answer":"Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all tutoring sessions are currently being held virtually (via Zoom)."},{"question":"Are the tutoring sessions a one-time thing or recurring?","answer":"They can be either! When you sign up, you can select whether you want to sign up for one session, recurring sessions, or if you are unsure!"},{"question":"Are the tutors paid or volunteers?","answer":"All tutors are high school volunteers, but they all meet the rigorous standards Tremendous Tutors sets in terms of academics and teaching experience."},{"question":"I've signed up for tutoring! Now what?","answer":"Your tutor will reach out to you shortly via email to coordinate a time that works for both of you for your session(s)."},{"question":"What subjects can you tutor in?","answer":"On the sign-up form there is an extensive list of subjects available to choose from. If you need assistance in a subject not currently listed, you can manually input the subject into the 'other' section, and we will try our best to accommodate you."}]
